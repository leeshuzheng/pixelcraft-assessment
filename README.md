## Pixelcraft Studios Technical Assessment

This front end development assessment was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) for ease of setting up.

I understand the team works with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) too, so it was my choice of framework to style my modals. On occasion, it was necessary for me to use [`css-modules`](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) to handle [component-specific styles](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css).

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and `cd` into the project root. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`, whichever you prefer. Once we have our `node_modules` folder, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
